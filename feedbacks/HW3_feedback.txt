Test Suite: 290/290


Valgrind: 5/5


Modularity: 3/5
(-2) QueryProcessor does not properly factor complicated function into
helpers and/or needs better comments. The helper function and complicated
code should be commented, and the code in ProcessQuery function could be
factored out more.


Robustness and error checking: 5/5


Comments, Blending, and other style issues: 2/5
(-1) Using reinterpret_cast instead of a more appropriate cast.
Generally, one should avoid using reinterpret_cast when they can.
static_cast is more appropriate for step 10 in WriteIndex.cc
(-1) Uses base types (e.g. void*) when a defined type (e.g. LLPayload_t)
would have been more appropriate. (i.e. step 13 in WriteIndex.cc)
(-1) Uses C idiom in C++ code. Should use nullptr instead of NULL for
step 1 in FileIndexReader.cc


Search shell: 4/5
(-1) Crashes (i.e. Verify333()) when handling input that contains no letters.


Short Answer Questions: 4/5
(-1) Does not have a correct reason for why we don't want a buffer to be on 
in this use case of file I/O for Q3.


Extra Credit: 0/5
